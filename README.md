Introduction
In this project, I dove into bike-share data from a fictional company called Cyclistic. Working through the full data analysis lifecycle—from asking the right questions and preparing the data to processing, analyzing, and sharing insights—I applied practical data skills to uncover meaningful patterns. Using a clear roadmap to guide the process, I ensured that each step built toward actionable recommendations. This case study showcases how I combine technical analysis with storytelling to help teams make informed decisions.

Scenario
As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a Chicago bike-share company, I support the marketing team’s goal to increase annual memberships. To achieve this, we aim to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. My role involves analyzing data, generating insights, and creating professional visualizations to inform recommendations. These findings will be presented to executives to guide a marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into annual members.

About the Company
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago. Since its launch in 2016, it has grown into a large-scale operation with thousands of riders each year.
Key Facts:
•	Founded: 2016
•	Fleet Size: 5,824 geo-tracked bicycles
•	Coverage: 692 docking stations across Chicago
•	Bike Access: Riders can unlock a bike from one station and return it to another at any time
Cyclistic offers flexible pricing options that have helped attract a wide range of users:
•	Single-ride and full-day passes are typically used by casual riders
•	Annual memberships are purchased by Cyclistic members
Initially, the company focused on broad marketing strategies to increase brand awareness and customer base. This approach, combined with flexible pricing, successfully grew the user base and made the service accessible to both short-term and regular users.
However, internal financial analysis has shown that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. Recognizing this, Director of Marketing Lily Moreno has proposed a strategic shift: rather than focusing on acquiring new users, the priority is to convert existing casual riders into annual members.
Current Marketing Focus:
•	Goal: Increase the number of annual memberships
•	Target audience: Current casual riders who are already familiar with the Cyclistic brand
•	Approach: Use data to understand rider behavior, preferences, and opportunities for conversion
•	Strategy: Analyze historical trip data to uncover patterns and develop targeted digital marketing campaigns
This shift marks a data-driven effort to boost membership and drive long-term growth for Cyclistic.




To shape Cyclistic’s future marketing strategy, the team is guided by three key questions:
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.	Why would casual riders consider switching to annual memberships?
3.	How can Cyclistic leverage digital media to convert casual riders into members?
As a junior data analyst on the marketing analytics team, I have been assigned to answer the first question:
 How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
This question is critical in identifying patterns in user behavior and informing strategies to encourage casual riders to become members.
