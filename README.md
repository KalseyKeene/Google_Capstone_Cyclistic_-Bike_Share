Project chosen for the Capstone: 
Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study – Summary
-	As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I analyzed ride data from Cyclistic, a fictional Chicago bike-share company. The goal was to help the marketing team convert casual riders into annual members by understanding differences in rider behavior.
Role and Objective
In my role as a junior data analyst, I explored the question:
"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
Key Project Tasks:
•	Defined the business goal and key stakeholders
•	Cleaned and analyzed a large dataset (4 M+ rows)
•	Used R programming for analysis and visualization
•	Identified trends in trip duration, time of day, and user type
•	Delivered actionable recommendations based on data insights
Business Impact
The findings support data-driven marketing strategies designed to boost annual memberships by targeting casual riders more effectively.

This concludes the overview of the Certificate information, background of the skill, and a quick summary of the project itself. For a full breakdown of the Cyclistic Bike-Share project and the steps used, please continue to the ‘My Project’
